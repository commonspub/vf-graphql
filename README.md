# vf-graphql
Reference GraphQL implementation of the ValueFlows spec

This is to help synchronize the projects using VF for a graphql interface between client and server.  It includes the VF specification, plus recommended vocabulary specification not part of the rdf-based VF spec but needed for all VF based implementations of economic software (for example Agent, Person, Organization, note, image).  It also includes recommended inverse relationship naming, which is particularly useful in graphql implementations.
